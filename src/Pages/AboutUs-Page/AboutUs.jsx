              Our nostalgic patisserie began three years ago in a cozy home kitchen, 
              where a passion for baking turned into a love affair with sweets. From humble beginnings with 
              homemade cakes, we've grown into a thriving bakery dedicated to crafting delectable cookies, cakes, and macarons. 
              Each bite tells a story, reflecting our commitment to using the finest ingredients and traditional techniques.
